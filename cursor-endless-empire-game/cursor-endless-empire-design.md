## 3. Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 3.1 Turn Structure
**Turn Phases**:
1. **Market & Economy** - Buy/sell resources, transactions, worker salaries, resource consumption
2. **Worker Actions** - Move, develop plots, work plots (with resources already available)
3. **Plot Production** - Resources generated based on worker actions

**Turn Flow**:
- Each turn represents a period of development and exploration
- Market activity happens first (buy resources needed for development)
- Workers perform their actions with resources already available
- Plot production follows from worker actions

### 3.2 Game State
Game state is stored as a JSON dictionary in localStorage with the following structure:
- **turn**: Current turn number
- **phase**: Current phase ("market_economy", "worker_actions", "plot_production")
- **plots**: Array of plot objects
- **workers**: Array of worker objects

**Plot Data Structure:**
- Each plot has ratings for each collected and extracted resource
- Owner (player/computer)
- State of undeveloped, farm, mine, power plant, town

**Worker Data Structure:**
- Each worker has a location and type

## 4. Resources

### 4.1 Core Resources
- **Money (üí∞)**: Primary currency for building and trading
- **Energy (‚ö°)**: Powers advanced buildings and special abilities
- **Food (üçé)**: Sustains population and enables growth
- **Trade Goods (üì¶)**: Specialized resources for community interaction

### 4.2 Resource Categories

**Collected Resources (Renewable)**:
- **Wind (üí®)**: Available in open areas, variable output
- **Sunlight (‚òÄÔ∏è)**: Available everywhere, varies by location/weather
- **Water (üíß)**: Flows naturally, can be collected/directed
- **Soil (üå±)**: Can be improved/regenerated over time

**Extracted Resources (Finite)**:
- **Coal (‚õèÔ∏è)**: High energy density, polluting
- **Stone (ü™®)**: Durable building material
- **Ore (‚öíÔ∏è)**: Raw metal source, requires processing

---

## 5. Plot System

### 5.1 Plot Resource Ratings
Each plot has a rating of 0-10 for each resource type:

**Collected Resources (Renewable)**:
- **Wind (üí®)**: 0-10 rating based on elevation and exposure
- **Sunlight (‚òÄÔ∏è)**: 0-10 rating based on latitude and weather patterns
- **Water (üíß)**: 0-10 rating based on proximity to rivers/lakes
- **Soil (üå±)**: 0-10 rating based on fertility and drainage

**Extracted Resources (Finite)**:
- **Coal (‚õèÔ∏è)**: 0-10 rating based on geological deposits
- **Stone (ü™®)**: 0-10 rating based on rock formations
- **Ore (‚öíÔ∏è)**: 0-10 rating based on mineral deposits

### 5.2 Plot Development
Plots can be developed for specific roles by placing the appropriate worker and providing necessary resources:

- **Farmer** ‚Üí Creates a **Farm** (requires soil + water)
- **Miner** ‚Üí Creates a **Mine** (requires stone/coal/ore deposits)
- **Blacksmith** ‚Üí Creates **Windmill** (requires wind), **Water Mill** (requires water), or **Boiler** (requires coal)
- **Trader** ‚Üí Creates a **Market** (requires population and trade routes)

### 5.3 Development Mechanics
- **Resource Requirements**: Each development type requires specific resource ratings
- **Worker Specialization**: Only the appropriate worker type can develop each plot type
- **Development Cost**: Credits and materials required to establish the development
- **Production Output**: Higher resource ratings result in better production efficiency

### 5.4 Starting Conditions
**Player Starting Assets:**
- **1 Town**: Starting base of operations
- **TBD Credits**: Starting money (amount to be determined)
- **1 Explorer**: Starting worker for discovery

**World Generation:**
- **Map**: Either read from file OR procedurally generated
- **Computer Towns**: 0 or more existing communities to discover

---

## 6. Worker System

### 6.1 Worker Types
- **Explorer**: Discovers new plots and converts them from unsettled to settled
- **Farmer**: Develops farms, produces agricultural resources
- **Miner**: Develops mines, extracts finite resources
- **Blacksmith**: Creates windmills, steam engines, tools
- **Trader**: Creates markets and manages trade relationships

### 6.2 Worker Mechanics
- **Salary**: 1 credit per turn per worker
- **Movement**: One plot per turn
- **Hiring**: Any settled plot can hire workers (player chooses worker type)
- **Specialization**: Each worker type has specific development abilities

### 6.3 Worker Actions
**Explorer Actions:**
- **Move**: Go to unsettled plot
- **Settle**: Convert plot from unsettled to settled, reveal plot attributes

**Other Worker Actions:**
- **Move**: Go to a settled plot
- **Develop Plot**: Transform settled plot into specific type (requires resources)
- **Work Plot**: Generate production from developed plot (ongoing action)

**Key Rules:**
- **No Worker = No Production**: Undeveloped plots and developed plots without workers produce nothing
- **Worker Allocation**: Each worker can only do one action per turn
- **Strategic Choices**: Balance between exploring/settling, developing new plots, and working existing plots
